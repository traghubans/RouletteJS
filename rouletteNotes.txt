Program Notes:

-We need to make a roulette wheel. 60 minutes. 

-User Inputs:
    -What type of bets they want to make
        -color
        -number
        -status
    -How much money they want to bet for this round

    -In order to acheive std input in JS we need to do it async / await with promises
    -This might affect the compile of the rest of the program 

-Program Architecture

    - Helper functions
        1. Capture user Inputs
        2. Calculate the price won if bet was correct
        3. Determine if the number is odd or even
        4. A program to actually complete the roulette 
            - Needs to return the number, color, and if it's odd or even
            - Needs to randomly get a number between 1 and 36, while also accounting for -1, or 00 
        
    -Extra Parameters 
        -We also need to make sure the program can be repeated.
        -We need to make sure that we can't set an amount more than the bankroll.
        -We need to give the user the ability to see the results.


Problems:
    
    1. Stdinput always running nonstop
        Solution: Using .pause made the program stop running after typing in the parameter

    2. functions after async won't run.
        Solution: I made the following function a promise as well, this allowed for it to be compiled and waited on.

    3. String was being recorded and shown, but it didn't match the switch case strings
        Solution: I added .trim(), I assume this trimmed off any other spaces given by the stdinput
